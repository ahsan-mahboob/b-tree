# b-tree

B-tree is a tree data structure that keeps data sorted and allows searches, insertions, and deletions in logarithmic amortized time.

Important properties of a B-tree:

<ul>
<li>B-tree nodes have many more than two children.
<li>A B-tree node may contain more than just a single element.
</ul>

Requirements to compile and execute:

<ul>
<li>JDK 6+ to build the B-Tree code.
<li>JDK 8 if you would like to build B-Tree simulator (that uses JGraphX).
</ul>
